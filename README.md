"Work Day Scheduler"

This is a calendar for your work day. It starts at 8 AM and runs through 5 PM.

It displays the current date,

You are able to type in the middle blue area, that is a textbox and it is where you can add what is going on during that time of day.

Then when you move your cursor over the red div box on the right hand side there is a hover effect and the cursor changes as well.

![insert] (I could not get the print screen to work and show off the hover and cursor function.)

That is a clickable element and it will save the information to your local storage.
